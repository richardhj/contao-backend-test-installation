Custom Backend Theme
====================

This bundle demonstrates how to provide a backend theme that will be available to the user to select.

File structure
--------------

**`/assets`:** The assets folder holds the theme files. You can organize all your CSS and JS files in there.

**`/assets/webpack.config.js`:** We are using Encore to define the Webpack config. The config defines the output path for dist files, i.e. `./src/Resources/public` and the public path, i.e. `/bundles/acmecontaocustomtheme`. The public path is predefined as it is your bundle name. You are free to generate the dist files in a sub-folder.

**`/src/Resources/public`:** Public path of bundle = Output of the dist files. This folder will be symlinked to `/bundles/acmecontaocustomtheme`.

**`/src/Resources/public/entrypoints.json`:** This file is generated by Encore and is needed to tell Contao which files to include.

**`/src/ContaoBackendTheme/BackendTheme.php`:** This class tells Contao to provide a new backend theme.

Build theme
-----------

First install NPM dependencies.

```
cd assets && yarn install
```

Build theme for production. For the correct use of PurgeCSS, all template files need to be available.

Therefore, first install all Composer dependencies.

```
composer install
```

With the templates being available (if needed at all), you can build the theme for production.

```
yarn build
```
